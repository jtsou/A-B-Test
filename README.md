# A/B Test

In this experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked “start free trial”, they
were asked how much time they had available to commit to the course. If the students have 5 or
more hours per week, they would go through the registration process as usual. However, if not;
a message would appear indicating that Udacity course usually require a greater time
commitment for successful completion. Students will also be told that they can access the course
materials for free.
